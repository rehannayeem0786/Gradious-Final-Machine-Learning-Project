# Gradious-Final-Machine-Learning-Project

ðŸš— Automobile Performance ML Project.
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview.
This project demonstrates a complete endâ€‘toâ€‘end Machine Learning workflow using an automobile performance dataset.
The primary objective is to predict fuel efficiency of vehicles based on their engine, design, and manufacturing attributes.
The project is structured to reflect the core ML pipeline:
- Data Preprocessing â€“ cleaning and preparing raw data
- Feature Engineering â€“ encoding, scaling, and handling outliers
- Model Training â€“ applying multiple regression algorithms
- Model Evaluation â€“ comparing performance with metrics and visualizations
- Insights & Future Work â€“ interpreting results and suggesting improvements
This workflow mirrors realâ€‘world ML projects, ensuring reproducibility, clarity, and scalability.
